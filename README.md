# For-Angry-GirlFriend

This project is a fun and interactive web application that displays lyrics with a balloon animation effect. Users can also send personalized messages through a separate page. I made this specially for my angry girlfriend. 

## Features

- **Lyrics Display**: Lyrics are displayed with a fade or typing effect based on the timing.
- **Balloon Animation**: Balloons float up the screen and can be popped to trigger a confetti effect.
- **Personalized Messages**: Users can send personalized messages through a form.

## About Sending Mails 

You can use EmailJS to enable the email-sending feature. Currently, I've implemented a PHP mailer, which is a straightforward solution but requires a hosting provider with PHP mailing services enabled. To support a purely static front-end setup, I plan to update the integration to use EmailJS.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/pinakkk/For-Angry-GirlFriend

    Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## File Structure
